//Ex.22 according to github
//Array with an error: The code below contains international error. We are trying to access the element at index 3 in the fruit array, but the array only has 0-2.
let fruit = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
console.log(fruit[3]);

//Corrected Array:
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
console.log(fruit[2]);
